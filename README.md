# JavaAlarms
The features that your program must have are as follows:
1. Add a new, one-time alarm for a specific date and time. The alarm can have an optional message. The user input should be the optional message.
2. The program should be capable of maintaining several alarms and manage how they go off. If multiple alarms are going off, each one of them should be a separate pop-up window (dialog boxes).
3. When an alarm goes off, a pop-up window (dialog) should open. The window should show: The optional message, A “Dismiss” button, and A “Snooze” option.
4. Your program should maintain the details of all the future alarms in CSV file. Feel free to define your own header to capture the details pertaining to an alarm. An alarm should be saved as soon as it is created.
5. (Extra) In addition to the pop-up window, have your program also play an audio clip. The clip should loop so long as the pop-up window for the alarm is open, and should stop as soon as it is closed. You can hardcode the audio clip for demonstration purposes or give the user an option to select it.
6. (Extra) Instead of using CSV, you can also save the alarms values in XML document. You can define your won tags with respective datatypes.
